I've written this article to summarise the essential steps that a student applying for graduate programs would generally go through. These are applicable to a majority of the programmes offered by the US. For Europe and other places, there might be some differences but the procedure will be similar. It is advisable of course, to confirm the exact steps to be followed as per the application requirements of the specific programme you're consider. 

I have listed these steps in the order in which I executed them, you are free to choose otherwise.
