I've written this article to summarise the essential steps that a student applying for graduate programs would generally go through. These are applicable to a majority of the programmes offered by the US. For Europe and other places, there might be some differences but the procedure will be similar. It is advisable of course, to confirm the exact steps to be followed as per the application requirements of the specific programme you're consider. Secondly, quite a few of these steps (writing an SoP for example) might be new for you . Thus the more you read, the better informed and better acquainted with these procedures you will be. Proactively surf the internet to find out extensively about each of such steps and various opinions on what to do and what not to do. For a compilation of such resources, see Kalpesh Krishna's blog [post](https://martiansideofthemoon.github.io/2018/05/29/grad-resources.html).

I have listed these steps in the order and timeframe which I followed, you are free to choose otherwise. Typical PhD application deadlines for the US are between 1st to 15th December.

Let me begin by explaining why I chose to go through these steps in the order specified. I studied for GRE and TOEFL in May and June since that was the time of my summer vacation and I had no academic coursework to look after. I appeared for both exams in the first week of July. I began browsing through the PhD programmes offered by various universities and the professors affiliated with those departments, in September after my mid-semester exam, since by then I had sufficient clarity on what fields I was already interested in or wanted to explore. By mid-October I'd shortlisted my own set of names, after which I began discussing these with senior students in my field and professors I knew. It was during this time that I asked my professors whether they would write letters of recommendations for me. Simultaneously, I made the first draft of my CV so that I could begin emailing professors, enquiring if they have open positions. From November, I first listed the exact requirements of each programme so that I would get ample time to prepare for anything unorthodox, and then began writing my SoP which went on till the applications deadlines.

<h2 id="exams"> GRE and TOEFL </h2>

### GRE

The Graduate Record Exam (GRE) tests you on three parameters - quantitative, verbal and essay writing. I closely followed Kalpesh Krishna's posts on <a href="https://martiansideofthemoon.github.io/2017/12/07/gre-toefl-preparation.html">GRE</a> and <a href="https://martiansideofthemoon.github.io/2017/12/07/gre-toefl-preparation-2.html">TOEFL preparation</a>. I will encourage you to read these posts as well. I used the same resources as mentioned in those blog posts (the books referred below are the same). Here are my suggestions in addition to those blog posts. I suggest some representarive times for each part of the preparation, which you should modify as per your comfort.

#### Preparation Time

I took about 6 weeks (in my summer vacation) to prepare for the GRE - about two weeks in May and four in June. I attempted the GRE in the first week of July. Preparing in the summer helped me significantly since I did not have any academic course load to deal with simultaneously. A few peers who gave the exam in their semester faced this issue. I would recommend students with a four year course to consider their third year winter break (since presumably they would be off on their intership in their third yeam summer) and five year course students to consider their fourth year summer break to prepare for the exam.

#### Verbal

Preparation for the verbal section consists of two main components: vocubulary and practice. In the first four weeks, I focussed only on building vocabulary. I practised words from the Magoosh vocabulary flashcards <a href="https://gre.magoosh.com/flashcards/vocabulary">app</a>. This app contains 1000 words. I only did the basic and common sections from this (which were about 600), since I found the advanced section too difficult. After that, I moved on the Barron's Essential words for GRE <a href="https://www.amazon.in/Barron%60s-Essential-Words-Philip-Geer/dp/9387477010">book</a> where I first practised the 300 selected words then went on to the rest (the book has a total of 800 words). There is some overlap between both sources. I continued revising and learning new words for the next two weeks. I reckon about 6-8 weeks of regular (daily) practise should be adequate for this preparation. 

After the first four weeks when I had a decent vocabulary built up, I began practising questions. I practised all questions from the ETS official GRE verbal reasoning practice questions <a href="https://www.amazon.in/Official-Verbal-Reasoning-Practice-Questions/dp/1259863484">book</a> and Barron's New GRE <a href="https://www.amazon.in/Barrons-New-GRE-Gre/dp/0764146165">book</a> (though I think any verbal practice questions book published by Barron's for the GRE should be fine). I would strongly recommend solving these questions under time limit, to get used to exam conditions. I feel that two weeks of regular problem solving should be enough.

#### Essay Writing

Two essays are required to be written: one where you analyse and critique an argument presented to you, and the other expressing your opinions on a topic of discussion. A good explanation of the expectations from both essays is given in the ETS official guide to the GRE general test <a href="https://www.amazon.in/Official-Guide-GRE-General-Test/dp/9352607376">book</a>. They also provide sample essays, and topics for practice. I practised all essays (with time limit) from here, and additionally essays from the practice tests that I had attempted. After the time limit (or the practice test) had elapsed, I rewrote my essays without a time limit as a way to enhance my practice.  All of them came with sample responses which I used for evaluating my essays (both, the version written with and without time limit). I think writing about 4-6 essays of both types would be good practice.

#### Quantitative

The quantitive section will be fairly straightforward for engineering students, and a revision of the concepts and formulae from the ETS official GRE quantitive reasoning practice questions <a href="https://www.amazon.in/Official-Quantitative-Reasoning-Practice-Questions/dp/9352607368">book</a> (with a bit of practice, as per your comfort) should be sufficient to get a good score (of 168 or higher). 

#### Practice Tests

I attempted the two online practice tests which were included with my registration. Other than that, practice tests can be obtained from various books like Manhattan, Barron's and even ETS.

#### Typical Scores

As per the heuristics I had heard, a score of 168/170 in quantitive, 155/170 in verbal and 4/6 in writing were "acceptable" for the programmes I was applying to. You can choose to follow these heuristics or create your own benchmarks after speaking to people or checking specific application requirements. 

### TOEFL

TOEFL consists of four sections: reading, writing, listening and speaking. Reading and writing will not be very difficult after practising for GRE. I would suggest looking up the format of the questions and giving one practise test. For listening and speaking, I followed the resources <a href="https://martiansideofthemoon.github.io/2017/12/07/gre-toefl-preparation-2.html">here</a>. I gave TOEFL within a few days of giving the GRE to ensure that my GRE preparing was still fresh. 

As per the heuristics I had heard, a total score of 90 or above in all sections was "acceptable" for the programmes I was applying to. You can choose to follow these heuristics or create your own benchmarks after speaking to people or checking specific application requirements. Some programmes may require a certain minimum score on certain sections like listening or speaking since TAship appointments may depend on that. Some programmes do accept students not satisfying these imposed requirements and ask them to do an English course after entering the unversity. It's best to check the exact program specifics in all cases. 


## Subject GRE

Engineering programmes don't generally require a subject GRE, but some programmes may encourage one. For example, CalTech encourages the applicant to have the maths subject GRE for applying to the CMS programme. 

<h2 id="shortlisting">Shortlisting Programmes and Professors</h2>

Visit the websites of various universities and browse through the list of professors in your departments of interest. A few sources to get names of universities and professors are

* QS World Rankings
* Your advisor's university and advisor, and the university and advisor of the advisor's advisor and so on
* Places where eminent researchers in your field work
* People whose papers or books you regularly refer to

This process is a stale, tedious drag which will tax your focus and determination. A little company helps in such times to relieve the weariness and offers empathetic reassurance of it indeed being mundane. Tabulate your findings in a spreadsheet, and once you are satisfied with your initial shortlist (I think about 10-12 should be a good number for this) start speaking to people. Ask for opinions from professorsand senior students you know who work in the field and you can approach for advice. They will give you their opinions about the places and people you have chosen, and may make new suggestions as well, according to which you can suitably modify your list. I think a final number between 7-9 is fine. More on shortlisting will be discussed in the next section on letters of recommendation. This list that you make might be modified somewhat as you go along, if you receive new suggestions that are really good, or if some professors are not taking students, or a any other reasons. 

For people interested in applying to control theory, be sure look at

This is not an exchustive list, and is stated in a loosely alphabetical order. Use it as potential starting points in your search, but make sure you explore each mentioned item thoroughly, so that you do not lose out on any information. I may have missed certain departments or research groups in the universities mentioned, or missed universities themselves.

<h2 id="lor"> Letter of Recommendations </h2>

Applications to engineering programmes in the US, for both master's and PhD, typically require at least 3 letters of recommendation. Some allow for more. For these letters, ask someone who you have interacted extensively with, and can advocate your excellent character and ability. Preferably, choose someone you have conducted research with or performed well in multiple courses with. Since the letter writing process is thought and effort intensive, make sure you ask them at least a month or month and a half in advance.  

First and foremost, confirm with your letter writers the list of the people and places you intend to apply to. Discuss your university shortlist with them. Once they approve of your shortlist (or at least, the part for which they shall be one of your letter writers), confirm that they have agreed to write letters for you in each of those applications. These extra steps will circumvent any confusion or potential discomfiture at a later time. They might ask you to send them a list of deadlines and give you specific instructions on sending reminders to make sure that all letters are submitted successfully, make sure you adhere to it. 

They might additionally ask you for your SoP and CV. If you have these documents ready, you can produce them immediately, or discuss a timeline with them on how you would be revising your drafts and at which stage of the draft would they like to see them. Look at these posts for more views on this topic (the last three links are taken from the appendix of the first)

* Prof. Prof. Shriram Krishnamurthi's <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Memos/Reco-From-Me/">views</a>

<h2 id="cv">Resume/CV</h2>

Most CVs I saw when I was making mine were 3-4 pages long. Mine as well was 4 pages long. For those universities which imposed a page restriction I had to shorten it. For attaching your CV (recall, attach it as a link) in your email, you could prepare a short CV which the professor can quickly go through at a glance. Or you could include two links, one to a shorter version and one to a longer version so that the reader has a choice.

<h2 id="email">Emailing</h2>

In an email you basically introduce yourself and your credentials, express interest in the recipient's research and enquire if they is willing to offer you a position. Do **NOT** have high hopes about receiving a reply since the recipients receives a lot of such emails everyday, and it says **nothing bad** about your credentials or strength as an applicant.

### Time of Emailing

There are two good time periods for sending emails to professors. One is before you submitting your application, and one after. In the former case, assuming you receive you guard against applying to people who aren't taking students at all, or if your profile matches their interests they may encourage you to apply which is a positive sign indicatin that they've noticed you. Even if they don't reply, reading your email might be enough for them to notice you (I did get offers from professors who didn't reply to my emails). The second good time is after you submit your application. You could inform them that you have successfully completed your application. This may get them to notice you and have a look at your application. I emailed them at both times, the first time asking them if they have positions and the next time politely informing them of having completed my application.

**Avoid** the time from 18th December (a week before Christmas) to 7th January (a week after new year), since this is typically holiday time. You can adjust both dates as you feel fit, but that is what I followed.

### Content

I would suggest that you keep the email to three paragraphs. In the first paragraph, give a two line introduction of yourself with your department major and minor, academic performance index (CPI/GPA/CGPA), professors you're currently working with, and other such details. In the second paragraph, mention the titles of your projects and the names of the professors and one line on relevant contributions (or link to publication or reports if any). In the end, express what work of the professor you are interested in in by citing the areas, and in special cases one or two representative publications, and enquire politely but formally if they have positions available. Sending an email before submitting your application ensures that you don't apply to professors not taking students, assuming of course that you receive replies. Include a **link** to your CV (and not the CV as an attachment). More on the CV in another section below. Keep the email as short as possible, assuming that they are going to spend anywhere between 30 seconds to 2 minutes in reading it. You can find many other suggestions and tips across the internet on sending such emails. 

### Graduate Students

You could email graduate students who are a part of the professor's group as well, asking about the group culture, the professor's research directions and advising style, the overall experience of the student in the programme and other such questions.

<h3> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmastra">Brahmastra</a> </h3>

If one of your recommenders writes an email to a professor you're applying to, advocating you, that would offer a very strong boost (though of course, its not a 100% guarantee that you'll get through) to your application.

<h2 id="prog-req">Listing Programme Requirements</h2>

This is a subtle but important step. Create accounts on all university application portals and carefully peruse their applications requirements. Some universities may have offbeat requirements, for example, University of Michigan at Ann Arbor asked us to like send an official (from the registrar's office) hard copy of the transcript along with a special application form before the application deadline. Fill up as much information on the application forms as possible to save time later.



<h2 id="sop">Statement of Purpose</h2>

Your Statement of Purpose (SoP) is essentially what you would say at an interview when the interviewer says, "Run me through your resume". Each of my statements were 2 page long (unless the university asked for a shorter one) and had about 1000 to 1200 words (unless the university imposed a word limit). I would suggest that you limit to 2 pages at a legible font (preferably 12 pt). I would suggest that you read through various opinions available on the internet about writing SoPs. For one such post which also refers to a collection of many other posts is <a href="https://swapneelm.github.io/how-to-write-a-statement-of-purpose-for-grad-school">here</a>. I think about a month or month and a half is a good estimate for the time taken to write one.

### Writing the SoP

Your SoP should address the following aspects each of which are considered individually below

* Your work so far, and how it has moulded you
* Your motivation for the programme you're applying to
* Your research interests, and your future goals
* Your interest in the university, programme, and the specific lab or professor

The SoP should primarily focus on your work so far, irrespective of domain, which establishes your competence and makes you a compelling candidate for the position you're applying to. For a PhD, this is primarily your research work so far (don't hesitate to include other projects if they add meaningful contribution to this) - even if its not strictly related to the area you're applying to, it reflects your qualities as a potential researcher. You need to demonstrate that you will be diligent, driven and competent in performing research. For a masters, it would be a combination of your research, coursework and other projects. For each of your projects, suucinctly state the problem statement and objective of the work and your contributions, conclusions and recommendations. Persuasively write about the impact, significance and importance of these contributions to the field. Then write about what you learnt from the project, both in terms of tangible knowledge (like getting acquainted with a certain software, or learning a new technique to solve an old problem) and abstract skills (getting an experience of defining a problem or converting an abstract problem into concrete mathematical form) or qualities (like determination, perseverance) that make you better suited for the position you're applying. This description of prior experience is the most important part of the SoP. It exhibits that you are a hardworking, determined, creative and proactive graduate student capable of paticipating in research (of course, you're not expected to be a fully independent researcher, but to display potential). If you have any publications or have preesented your work anywhere, be sure to mention them. Its up to you whether to arrange these projects chronologically or in order or importance, or in any other way you feel comfortable with. You can also cite examples of your communication or leadership skills, as they will subtly decorate your application.   

Your motivation (which could include a childhood dream) towards the programme, and current research interests can draw from your previous projects, or your excitement towards a newly emerging field, or a field you had taken a course in and want to explore, or any other reason that you find yourself drawn towards it. Try as much as possible to connect these aspects with your previous work. Your research interests will tell the reader if you are a good fit to their programme. You can always mention your interests and say that you're open to other exciting ideas as well. Professors would look for graduate students who have their own opinions but who also can be moulded as per their thinking and advising style. Its good to add one line about what your want to do further (continue into academia, go into industry or whatever else you would like to do) and how this programme will help you on that path. 

Express what aspects of the university and the programme attract you. For a PhD, find out the professors or labs whose research interests (fully or partially) you, give a short descrption of the work that you find interesting, and add how you will add value to their group. Convey that you have gone through their work in sufficient depth to understand the its scope and theme, and if possible, try to suggest new research directions.

I structured my SoP as follows: a brief introduction to my motivation for a PhD, my research areas till now, and the areas I'm interested in for the future. Then I described each of my projects (both research and others) and what I gained from each one of them, in terms of concrete knowledge or abstract qualities. I concluded this by adding some details on the coursework which I wanted to highlight. Subsequently, I summarised how my takeaway from the work done so far would help me as PhD student, laid out my research interests in detail. I concluded by explaining why I am interested in the particular university and the programme, and wrote about the professors or labs whose research I am particularly excited about.


### Revieweing the SoP

The first draft that you write will generally be atrocious. It will undergo an extensive review process involving you re-reading it countless times and your reviewers making numerous suggestions. Usually, you would want the first few reviews to be detailed and comprehensive, because your draft will probably need that kind of input and critique. In the first few revision, your draft will undergo significant and fundametal changes. At the end of this cycle, the second draft thus produced it will be substantially different from your first draft and its quality will have more or less reached a saturation point, and you will end up making only minor changes or high level changes, but its core will essentially be intact.

I would suggest having two sets of reviewers. One "close" set of 3-4 people, who will provide scrutinise your writing and provide detailed reviews, but do so speedily and be ready to do that same for multiple iterations. The second "outer" set of 10-15 people who would give high level comments and may do so at their own pace. The close reviewers would be ideal for reviewing your first draft and the outer reviewers would be ideal for the second draft. When the close reviewers review it, ask them to do so serially, i.e. only after you incorporate the changes made by the first person do you give the revision to the second person for review, and then to the third, then back to the first and so on. This is because in case you give it to two people at the same time, if you incorporate the changes made by one of them, since they would be so significant, it would outdate the copy which the other possesses and make their suggestions ineffective. For the second draft, you can send it to multiple reviwers paralelly, since the suggestions would be minor. 

Confirm with your letter writers if they want a copy of your SoP. It would be a good idea to ask them to review your SoP, since they would look at it from an entirely different angle. You could ask other professors to review it as well.


<h2 id="submit"> Submitting the Applications </h2> 

Carefully check all your details. Make sure you have attached the correct SoP, CV and other supporting documents. 

For more applications in the US, you will require an **international credit card** which can make payments in USD. For other applications, find out in advance if you require an international credit card and make sure you have one (either your own, or belonging to someone who you know) available when you submit the application. 

<h2 id="intweviews"> Interviews </h2> 

Once you are admitted, you'll have an interview with a professors representing the department or programme. It might or might not be someone whose research you have expressed interest in, or it might be someone from the admissions committee (or perhaps someone else entirely). The aim of the interview is to get to know you better, in terms of your previous research work and further interests and your expectations from the programme, and also for you to understand the programme better and be able to ask any questions you might have. This helps them determine your fit with the programme. Treat it as another interaction with one of your peers, but in a more formal setting. Since you have already established your competence through your SoP and CV, don't think of it as a stressful job interview where you have to answer a barrage of technical questions to prove your ability. Yes, some people may ask you technical questions or give you a problem to solve, but they would not be too concerned about your exact answer as long as your approach was fine. Even if you falter you won't be instantly pounced upon or rejected and you can always email them later with the correct answer. Here are a few concrete suggestions for the interview:

* Take notes during the interview. They will help you later if you have multiple offers.
* Be prepared with an answer to “tell me about yourself”, since this is typically the opening question. Include a summary of your relevant work (research, coursework, technical projects). It should be a walkthrough of your resume. Try to keep it to 5 minutes. Make sure to emphasize details which you would like to highlight about yourself, which could be difficult coursework you have undertaken, your perseverance, or anything else.
* The professor may ask you what you want to work on next. Have an idea of what you want to work on. It could also be that you are open to exploring new areas that you find interesting. You could as well have a specific area in mind. It could be a mix of both wherein you have a broad area in mind but are open to specific topics. It would be good if you could justify some motivation for any area that you quote. The motivation could also be that you want to explore that area and you haven’t before. In that case show how you are a good learner and can pick up that topic quickly. 
* Be prepared with questions for them. Ask them questions which will affect your stay in their lab or group. Ask them about their advising style, research group culture, projects, collaborations. A few examples are:
  - Ask about their current research. Ask about their collaborations.
  - Ask about the freedom they typically give graduate students with respect to their research topics. Do they expect the student to come up with ideas and drive the research or do they have preset areas in their mind where they would like you to work in? This will give you an idea of what their advising style is and if it suits you.
  - Ask about meeting frequency and times. Whether they have individual or group meetings.  
  - Ask if they require their students to take a particular set of courses or are students free to choose. 
  - Ask them about their view on internships. 
  - Ask them about funding, and whether they nominate their students for fellowships (fellowships are generally considered prestigious since you get paid by funds other than your advisor’s funds and that way you needn’t even TA).
* Have an answer to why the university, department and professor. They may ask about your other applications. Be honest there. If asked about priority, it’s best to be honest, since even if you decline their offer, you may interact with them sometime later in the future.
