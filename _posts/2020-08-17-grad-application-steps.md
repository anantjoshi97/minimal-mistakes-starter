I've written this article to summarise the essential steps that a student applying for graduate programs would generally go through. These are applicable to a majority of the programmes offered by the US. For Europe and other places, there might be some differences but the procedure will be similar. It is advisable of course, to confirm the exact steps to be followed as per the application requirements of the specific programme you're consider. 

I have listed these steps in the order which I followed, you are free to choose otherwise. Typical PhD application deadlines for the US are between 1st to 15th December.

  <li> LoR </li>
  <li> Resume/CV </li>

  <li> Submitting the application </li>
  <li> Interviews </li>
</ol>

Let me begin by explaining why I chose to go through these steps in the order specified. I studied for GRE and TOEFL in May and June since that was the time of my summer vacation and I had no academic coursework to look after. I appeared for both exams in the first week of July. I began browsing through the PhD programmes offered by various universities and the professors affiliated with those departments, in September after my mid-semester exam, since by then I had sufficient clarity on what fields I was already interested in or wanted to explore. By mid-October I'd shortlisted my own set of names, after which I began discussing these with senior students in my field and professors I knew. It was during this time that I asked my professors whether they would write letters of recommendations for me.
