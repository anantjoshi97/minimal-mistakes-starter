long intership, get solid work done. iitb is also good for this. 

why intern? foreign tour, project on a topic of choice which is not in the institute, lor, name of the univ/company, name of the prof, exploration of new and completely unknown fields, or having fun

profs don't like interns

finding profs: online, connections

The steps to finding and preparing for an internship are as follows
<ul>
  <li> <a href="#decide">Decide why</a> </li>
  <li> Finding people and institutions </li>
  <ul>
  <li> Pointers for in a research internship </li>
  <li> Project back home? </li>
  </ul>
  <li> Emailing </li>
  <li> Secure funding and visa </li>  
</ul>

<h2 id="decide"> Deciding why </h2>
Be clear on why you want to pursue an internship. There could be various reasons to apply, including but not restricted to the following
<ul>
  <li> having fun </li>
  <li> pursuing a project on a topic you're interested in, but no faculty in your college work on it </li>
  <li> to get a letter of recommendation while applying for future studies or positions, or to get the name of the organisation you're working in on your resume </li>
  <li> exploring an entirely new or unknown field out of curiosity</li>
  <li> indulging in foreign culture </li>
  <li> as a new experience </li>
</ul>
Be crystal clear on what your reasons are for applying to the internship, since it will greatly ease the process of choosing an internship. There is no problem with whatever reason you have in mind. Different people have different reasons. For example, if you want fun then you could intern at an NGO which conducts activities to your liking instead of the conventional internships that appear through PT cell. If you want a new experience, you could apply anywhere you want. If you want to explore an entirely new field, you would have many options, since its presumably a field you've heard about and which is growing fast, hence it would be studied at many places throughout the world. If you want to pursue a specific project or topic, your options would be narrower but you would have better reason to apply, possibly some prior experience too, which might increase your chances of getting selected. If you want the name of the organisation, university or professor on your resume, you'd have to make an appropriate choice. If you want to experience foreign culture, select a culture you like and apply anywhere you want within that culture. You may also have multiple reasons to pursue an internship. Your applications would then be suitably tailored to those.

<h2 id="find"> Finding places to apply </h2>

Once you know why you would like to pursue an internship, start looking for places to apply. Make an organised database, and colour code it to make it easier to parse. Speak to your peers, seniors, and professors about places that might interest you. If possible, ask a professor if they have any contacts, and would recommend you. Such an email will have a much stronger impact than an email that you send. However, remember, that it's not a sureshot method of getting selected, just more probable. If conducting solid research is one of your objectives (and remember, it need not necessarily be!), let us go over a few points you can keep in mind.

<h3 id="research"> Pointers for in a research internship </h3>

Try to either start early or continue working remotely after the internship. In the former case, you can read up on some fundamentals which will allow you to begin the real work much quicker. In the latter case, you could finish up on some small nuances that you didn't have time earlier to explore, or write a publication. This way, you can work for more than the two or three months. In my opinion, it takes more than the 2-3 months of the intership to get something really good done, and this additional time allows one to achieve that completion. 

You always have an option of finding an internship with a well defined problem (if that's fine with you), so that your work would be streamlined. The upside is that you will spend more time working and less time hunting for what to do. However, the downside is that you will miss out on the learning that the process of defining your own problem brings with itself. 

Lastly, getting a publication is always a plus point. Although its not necessary, and in some cases, it might not be possible, since your work might be a small part in a large project (but if the work eventually gets published, you can always be a co-author), or you may end up getting dismaying results and realising that the choice of problem was not good to begin with (which happens many times, and you cannot do much to correct it due to the short duration of the internship). But its always a plus to publish your findings.

apply on your own, don't stop at PT cell

it's just one summer. yes it does a lot of good things for a few people, but that doesn't mean that if you don't have one you're nothing.
